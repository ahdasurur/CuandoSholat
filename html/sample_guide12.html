<p style="text-align: justify;">It debuted at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. Produced on commission in limited units, as of 2019 a total of 140 cars had been built, including development mules. Variants include a 2-door coup&eacute; and roadster variant, along with a third new variant being the barchetta. Construction is mainly of carbon fibre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Zonda was originally to be named the "Fangio F1" after Formula One champion Juan Manuel Fangio, but, following his death in 1995, it was renamed for the Zonda wind, a term for a hot air current above Argentina.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Zonda C12[4] debuted in 1999 at the Geneva Motor Show. It is powered by a 6.0 L (366 cu in) Mercedes-Benz M120 V12 engine having a power output of either 400 PS (294 kW; 395 hp) or 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp)[5] at 5,200 rpm and 570&ndash;640 N&sdot;m (420&ndash;472 lb&sdot;ft) of torque at 4,200 rpm mated to a 5-speed manual transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The C12 can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 4.0 seconds and to 161 km/h (100 mph) in 9.2 seconds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only five cars were built with the 6.0 L engine, though the C12 was still available in 2002 when the C12 S was introduced. One was used for crash testing and homologation, while another was a demonstrator and show car. The remainder were delivered to customers during the next three years. The crash test and homologation car having chassis number 001 was restored by Pagani's recently established restoration program called "Pagani Rinascimento" and was presented to the public at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show for the Zonda's 20th anniversary.</p>
