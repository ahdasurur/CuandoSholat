<p style="text-align: justify;">The project began with the aim of making a global car, designed and engineered to comply with global safety and environment regulations, particularly to enter the United States car market. To sell cars in the US, many alterations were made to the design of the CCR; the previously used Ford Modular engine was replaced by an in-house developed Koenigsegg engine designed to run on 91 octane fuel, readily available in the United States, and to meet Californian emission standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The name CCX is an abbreviation for Competition Coup&eacute; X, the X commemorating the 10th anniversary (X being the Roman numeral for ten) of the completion and test drive of the first CC prototype in 1996.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CCX was unveiled at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, sporting body modifications to meet US vehicle regulations and a new in-house developed 4.7L twin supercharged V8 engine capable of generating a maximum power output of 817 PS (601 kW; 806 hp) at 7,000 rpm and 920 N&sdot;m (679 lb&sdot;ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm while running on 91 octane gasoline.</p>
